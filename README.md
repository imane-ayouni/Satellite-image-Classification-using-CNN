# Satellite-image-Classification-using-CNN
A convolutional network to classify aerial footage of different categories

## Topic

In this notebook I will work on classifying saltellite images of four kinds of body: water, desert, green area and cloudy. The dataset contains roughly 1500 instances on each type 
of aerial footage and will be seperated into training, validation and testing batches. I chose to work with a simple CNN (only a fex layers) after processing the images to be machine 
learning ready. 

## Objectives

- Process image data
